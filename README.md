# Human-disease-prediction-system-using-machine-learning
The main objective of this project to predict the human diseases based on the symptoms. The disease prediction system has data sets collected from different health related sites. With the help of disease predictor the user will be able to know the probability of the the diseases with the given symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: 
 1. Collect and pre-process patient data from reliable sources. 
 2. Explore various machine learning algorithms suitable for disease prediction. 
 3. Train and test the models to evaluate their performance. 
 4. Optimize the models for better accuracy and reliability. 
 5. Develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to use the prediction tool. 

Methodology:  
 
*Model: Naive Bayes Classifier. 
 
*Training: The model is trained on the dataset to learn the correlation between symptoms and diseases.

*Testing: The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test dataset.

*GUI Development:*Built with Tkinter.
* Allows users to select symptoms and view the predicted disease.
