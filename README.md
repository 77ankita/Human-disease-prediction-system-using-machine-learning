 Human-disease-prediction-system-using-machine-learning
The main objective of this project to predict the human diseases based on the symptoms. The disease prediction system has data sets collected from different health related sites. With the help of disease predictor the user will be able to know the probability of the the diseases with the given symptoms.

OBJECTIVES:
 
 1. Collect and pre-process patient data from reliable sources. 
 2. Explore various machine learning algorithms suitable for disease prediction. 
 3. Train and test the models to evaluate their performance. 
 4. Optimize the models for better accuracy and reliability. 
 5. Develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to use the prediction tool. 

Methodology:  
 
*Model: Naive Bayes Classifier. 
 
*Training: The model is trained on the dataset to learn the correlation between symptoms and diseases.

*Testing: The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test dataset.

*GUI Development:*Built with Tkinter.
* Allows users to select symptoms and view the predicted disease. 

*ALGORITHM:Naive Bayes algorithm :This system accepts the input from the user and predicts the most probable disease.This is achieved with the help of the dataset and the machine learning algorithm.The algorithm here is Naive Bayesian which works on a probabilistic approach.

We have imported Scikit to learn the library for its implementation. For this, we have used multinomial NB since multiple variants i.e. multiple symptoms are taken.

SOFTWARE TO BE USED: Programming Language  * Python: For implementing the Naive Bayes classifier and other machine learning algorithms.

* Libraries
*Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and data pre-processing.
*Pandas: For handling and manipulating the dataset.
*NumPy: For numerical computations. 
*Tkinter: For developing the graphical user interface. 

*EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

 Prediction in machine learning allows organizations to make predictions about possible outcomes based on historical data. These assumptions allow the organization to make decisions resulting in tangible business results. Predictive analytics can be used to anticipate when users will churn or leave an organization.
